# CleanArchitecture_ProductHunt_Client
This is a test project using clean architecture.

It's just a playground project. Nothing special. 

Also, using Dagger2 + RxJava2 - because why not? :)

Todo:
* Add more tests
* Build centralized gradle build configurations
* Maybe use the new archituecture componenets?
